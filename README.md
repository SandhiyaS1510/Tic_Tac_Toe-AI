🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI – The Ultimate Unbeatable Opponent!
🚀 An advanced Tic-Tac-Toe AI that never loses! This project implements a powerful Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, making the AI strategic, efficient, and impossible to defeat. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this game will challenge your logic and game theory skills!

🌟 Features

✅ Unbeatable AI – Uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.

✅ Alpha-Beta Pruning – Improves efficiency by reducing unnecessary calculations.

✅ Smart Move Evaluations – AI understands winning, blocking, and optimal strategies.

✅ Human vs. AI Mode – Play against the machine! 🤖

✅ AI vs. AI Mode – Watch two AI agents battle it out! 🎭

✅ GUI & CLI Support – Play in Tkinter (GUI) or Terminal (CLI).

✅ Web-Based Version – (Optional) Run it using Flask for a web-based interface.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Minimax Algorithm for AI decision-making

Alpha-Beta Pruning for performance optimization

Tkinter for a GUI-based game (optional)

Flask for a web-based version (optional)

🚀 Getting Started

🔹 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
cd tic-tac-toe-ai

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.

🎮 How to Play

1️⃣ Start the game – Choose between CLI, GUI, or Web version.

2️⃣ Make your move – Select a cell (1-9) or click in the GUI.

3️⃣ AI responds instantly – The AI calculates the best move using Minimax.

4️⃣ Game ends when – A player wins or the board is full (draw).

🤖 AI Logic (How It Works)

🔹 Minimax Algorithm – AI evaluates all possible moves and selects the best one.

🔹 Alpha-Beta Pruning – Eliminates unnecessary paths to speed up decision-making.

🔹 Winning Strategy – AI always chooses the path that guarantees a win or a draw.

🔥 Example Gameplay (CLI Mode)

  1 | 2 | 3  
 -----------
  4 | 5 | 6  
 -----------
  7 | 8 | 9  

Your Turn (X): 1
AI (O) plays: 5

  X | 2 | 3  
 -----------
  4 | O | 6  
 -----------
  7 | 8 | 9  

🔹 AI makes strategic moves! Try to beat it if you can!

🎯 Future Improvements

🔹 Add a difficulty setting (Easy, Medium, Hard)

🔹 Multiplayer online version with Flask & WebSockets

🔹 Voice commands for moves using Speech-to-Text

🔹 Machine learning-based AI (instead of rule-based Minimax)
